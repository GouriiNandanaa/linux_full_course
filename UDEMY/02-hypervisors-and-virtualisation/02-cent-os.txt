Cent OS vs cent os stream
    community enterprise os

    2004 greag kurtzer take the code of Red Hat OS 
    and put different branding on that called it as cent os
    lot of vouteens contributed on the os

    later in 2014, red hat come back and getback cent os

    before fe 2021,
    Fedora -> RHEL -> CentOS

    after feb 2021
    Fedora -> Cent os stream -> RHEL


    Now the centos is called as upstream instead of downstream becauase of this 
    updates are now pushed from the Cent os stream to rhel
    previously it was in reverse order
