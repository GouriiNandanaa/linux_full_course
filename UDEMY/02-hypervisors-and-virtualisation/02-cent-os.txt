    community enterprise os

    2004 greag kurtzer take the code of Red Hat OS 
    and put different branding on that called it as cent os
    lot of voluteers contributed on the os

    later in 2014, red hat come back and getback cent os

    before fe 2021,
    Fedora -> RHEL -> CentOS

    after feb 2021
    Fedora -> Cent os stream -> RHEL


    Now the centos is called as upstream instead of downstream becauase of this 
    updates are now pushed from the Cent os stream to rhel
    previously it was in reverse order

    CentOS Linux and CentOS Stream differ fundamentally in how they relate to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). The classic CentOS Linux distribution was a downstream rebuild of RHEL, designed to be functionally identical and extremely stable. CentOS Stream, by contrast, is positioned upstream of RHEL and serves as a continuously updated preview of the next RHEL minor release. This shift represents a change in philosophy rather than a simple renaming.
