Nat and bridge adapter
The main difference is NAT (Network Address Translation) acts like a router, giving VMs internet access via the host but hiding them, while Bridged Adapter makes the VM a separate, full network participant, getting its own IP and appearing as another physical device on the network, allowing direct access from other machines.

You can use any of the ubuntu
but 80% of the cooperate use the rhel
and cent os is the same as rhel [free]


we can snapshot the state of the vm 
and we can revert to this state actually
