find
locate
    these are the commands used to find files in linux

for searching we cant search the entire thing 
by typing ls -l

find . -name "kramer"
. -> means to check the present working directory
-name means the searching element is the name


locate kramer
    this is one another command to find the location of the kramer
locate command does not op any result, then as root run "updatedb" -this command is used to update the locate db
also make sure that you have "mlocate" package installed
to check = rpm -qa | grep mlocate

locate and find difference
    locate uss prebuilt db which should be regularly updated
    find iterated over a fs to locate files.

    locate is much faster than find but can be inaccurate if the db is not updated (cache)

    need sudo permission to updatedb
