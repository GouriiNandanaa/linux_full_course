touch filename 
    to create files
    touch newfile

cp newfile newfileForCopy


vi or vim editor
if the version is new, better to use vim
but both are the same
    to get out of the editor
    press :wq!
    then only we will get out of the editor
    

also when using touch we can 
    touch file1 file2 file4


create a directory we can use the command
    mkdir newDirectory

NOTES:
also  a normal user cant create files outside the home directory
only root have the permission to create files in /folders

To make the copy of a directory also we can use the command 
cp -R <source_file> <destination_file>
cp -R config /tmp/config-bak
