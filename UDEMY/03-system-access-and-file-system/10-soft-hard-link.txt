inode = it is a pointer of a file in the hard disk
if i create a file called gouri, that is a name for me so that human would understand that 
but not a computer
but computer understands numbers
and whenever we create a file, computer assigns a number to that file in the hard disk.
that number is the inode
when we try to read or write that file it goes to retreive that number



soft link will be removed if the file is removed or renamed
if i create a file and create a link, a soft link to that fiel and so i remove the source file it will remove the destination link

but the hard link remains the same even after deleting renaming or moving the original file.

create a link 
    ln (for hard link)
    ln -s (for soft link)


    ------------inode-----------------
    ^                       ^
    |                       |
my-hard-link           myfile.txt
                          ^
                          |
                          |
                      my-soft-link


On the right hand side, my-soft-link, it is connecting through myfile to the inode.
Whereas my-hard-link is connecting straight to the inode.
So if the middle part, which is myfile.txt, goes away, my-soft-link goes away.
However, in my-hard-link file, if middle file, myfile.txt goes away, it doesn't matter, the file stays.


links are basically like a shortcut like we create a shortcut in the windows desktop

note:
we cant create links within the same dir with the same name. so use temp folder /tmp

ln -s /home/gourinandana/gouri
ls -i
    gives the inodes

so go to home ls -i
 1180887  gouri 
 go to tmp and ls -i
 17533304 gouri

 both gives differnt inode number
 then go to home and remove gouri
 then go to tmp and ls -ltr gouri
    changes the color 
    and if we try to print the contents
    it will show file dont exist error
so this is how a soft link works


hard link works only if the link and file is in the same partition
create a file in home
create a hard link in tmp
after creating ls -l in the tmp wont show any pointing like they do in the soft link
if we edit the source / dest both will change
inode number will be same in 
even if remove source, link exists
