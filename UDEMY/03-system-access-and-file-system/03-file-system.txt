what is file system?
it is  a system used by an os to manage files. The system controls how data is served or retrieved.
os stores f&d in an organized and structured way
    system confi => folder a
    user files => folder b
    log files => folder c
    commands and scripts => folder d


there are many dffrnt types of file system. In general improvements are made to fs with new release of os and each new fs has been given a dffrnt name

linux file system - ext3, ext4, xfs
windows - ntfs and fat

if we go to file explorer -> c drive
then we can see file system built while buiding the os
program files and program files x86 used to store files of the applications installed into the computer

User directory to store details of the user
 
 os files in windows


 in linux
 everything starts from root (/)


 File system in linux
 ---------------------

 /boot - contains file that is used to boot loader (Eg: grub.cfg)
grub.cfg is the main configuration file for GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader).
It tells GRUB what operating systems are available, which kernel to boot, and what boot parameters to use.
It is the first thing the os that needs to boot up, the system lookd for /boot
It is somehow hardcoded in the disk

/root
it is the root user home directory
It is not / (root)
When you boot into a linux system as root and you do pwd
you will be in /root not just /

/dev
This is the system device such as a disk, s CD-ROM, speakers, flash drive, keyboard, mouse or any of those peripheral devices
They are created as files in linux and they will be in the dev directory


/etc 
configuration files
if you are running sendmail, nfs, ntp or any app that actually runs on top of your linux machine, all those conf files are located here
if you want to modify something on these files like dns we will go to this /etc name.com
sendmail -> sendmail.cf
if you are making any changes in this dir, first make a back up of that files


/bin 
in newer version it is /usr/bin
everyday user commands
ls, pwd


/sbin 
in newer version it is /usr/sbin
this is the system / file system commands
the commands that you really need for system type of purposes
extending the fs or configure the fs


/opt
optional add on applications
not part of OS
not for apps like ntp dns, 
they are actually come with os
opt is for third party applications


/proc
create files for all the running processes (only exist in the memory)
when shutting down there will be nothing in /proc
it is the program kernal that create all these files in that directory


/lib  -> usr/lib
it is all the c programming library files needed for all commands and applications
all the commands like ls pwd have libraries attatched to them so that they can go and look for and thats how these programs are run
For identifying which library is used for each command 
strace -e open pwd


/tmp
directory for temporary files


/home
directory for user


/var
system logs 


/run
temporary run time files like PID files
go away when system is shut down


/mnt
mount external file system


/media
for cdrom mounts
