 File system in linux
 ---------------------

 /boot - contains file that is used to boot loader (Eg: grub.cfg)
grub.cfg is the main configuration file for GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader).
It tells GRUB what operating systems are available, which kernel to boot, and what boot parameters to use.
It is the first thing the os that needs to boot up, the system lookd for /boot
It is somehow hardcoded in the disk

It is not / (root)
When you boot into a linux system as root and you do pwd
you will be in /root not just /

/dev
This is the system device such as a disk, s CD-ROM, speakers, flash drive, keyboard, mouse or any of those peripheral devices
