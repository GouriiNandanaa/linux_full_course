2 types of access
    console
    remote


console is a direct access to an os when it is connected through vga, hdmi, dvi, etc..

remote access allows you to connect to your os remotely over the nw

you can enter the ip of the distant machine and then it allows you to connect to other ventors machine

to connect linux through windows machine remotely you need PuTTY. Once you download it and installed then you get your IP address of your linux machine. you will enter the ip address and you will be able to connect as command line


if you are using 10 or new windows then no need of installing PuTTY
it already has a ssh built in client
go to your command prompt
and type ssh + space + ipv4 address

PuTTY is only used to connect windows with linux with windows version below 10
