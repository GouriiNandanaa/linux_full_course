unix is a multi user system. Every file and directory in your account can be protected responsibility for controlling access to their files.

3 types 
    read
    write
    execute

each permission is controlled by 3 levels
    user - u - yourself
    group - g - can be people in the same project
    other - o - everyone on the system

ls -l 
10  bit
1st bit is the file type
    next 3 permission of the user
    next 3 - group
    next 3 - others

chmod - change permissions
chmod u+r filename
chmod a-r filename
    this is for all the levels remove read permission

if we remove all permissions are try to delete it will show a warning sign 

and cat ing that shows permission denied



also x in directory means that we can cd into that directory
permission denied


we can do that using numeric value as well

chmod ugo+r newfile
instead of doing this we can 
chmod 444 newfile


chmod 764 newfile
means
7 - 111 - all permission to user
6 - 110 - read write to group
4 - 100 - read only to others


put 0 if you dont want to give any permission to that level
