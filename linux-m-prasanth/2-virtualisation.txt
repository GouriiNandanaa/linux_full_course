for testing the app and you only have windows
sometimes we need linux

to learn linux and all
we need virtual machine

by using virtualisation, we can use another operating systems



hypervisor--
------------------

it is the software that creates and runs virtual machine
with that we can use multiple os


how hypervisor works
virtual box share hardware resources from host os
separate set of virtual cpu, ram, storage

for eg:
if you have a cpu with 8gb ram and 100gb hdd where you run windows
then you ca split it into 2gb ram and 10gb hdd for ubuntu and the same for macos


virtual box share hardware resources from the host os
