RHEL----
----------
Fedora acts as an upstream testing platform.
CentOS is a close clone of RHEL.
Oracle Linux is mostly a copy of RHEL with some modifications.
RHEL supports hardware platforms such as Intel x86, ARM, Itanium, and PowerPC.
It uses YUM and DNF RPM package managers to install, update, and remove packages on the system.
RHEL is widely used by enterprises that host their own systems.



Detailed notes------
------------------------
1. Fedora – The Upstream Testing Platform

Fedora is a community-driven Linux distribution sponsored by Red Hat.

Think of Fedora as the "testing ground" for new features that might eventually make it into Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

It gets the latest software updates and technologies first — which means it’s great for developers and enthusiasts who want to experiment with cutting-edge tools.

Because Fedora changes quickly and releases new versions every 6 months, it’s not meant for long-term production servers, but it helps RHEL stay modern and secure.

2. CentOS – The Free RHEL Clone (Now Stream)

CentOS used to be a free, binary-compatible clone of RHEL, meaning it was almost identical to RHEL but without the paid support.

This made it very popular for businesses and developers who wanted RHEL’s stability without the subscription cost.

In recent years, CentOS has shifted to CentOS Stream, which is slightly ahead of RHEL (receives updates before they go into RHEL).

This makes CentOS Stream a kind of "preview" of what the next RHEL release will look like.

3. Oracle Linux – RHEL-Compatible with Extra Features

Oracle Linux is another RHEL-compatible distribution, created by Oracle.

It is designed to be fully compatible with RHEL, so software that runs on RHEL usually runs on Oracle Linux without changes.

Oracle also adds some of its own kernel options (like the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel) and performance tweaks for Oracle software.

It’s free to use, but you can pay for Oracle support if you need enterprise-level help.

4. RHEL – The Enterprise Standard

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a commercial Linux distribution designed for businesses.

It’s known for its stability, long-term support, and security.

Red Hat provides professional support, updates, and certifications that many companies rely on.

Hardware Support: RHEL runs on multiple architectures:

Intel x86 / x86_64 (most common PCs and servers)

ARM (used in cloud servers and some IoT devices)

PowerPC (used in some enterprise servers)

Itanium (used in legacy enterprise hardware)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. YUM and DNF – The Package Managers

RHEL (and its clones) use RPM packages to install software.

YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) and DNF (Dandified YUM) are tools that make installing, updating, and removing software easy.

For example, if you want to install a web server like Apache, you can just run:

sudo dnf install httpd


and it will automatically download and set up everything you need.

6. Why Enterprises Love RHEL

Long-Term Support: RHEL versions are supported for up to 10 years.

Security: Red Hat provides regular patches and security updates.

Certification: Many enterprise apps (like SAP, Oracle DB) are officially certified to run on RHEL.

Stability: Perfect for servers that need to run reliably 24/7.
